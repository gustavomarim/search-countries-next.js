### Continued development

I want to continue studying good software development practices, learning more about componentization of elements, reuse of functions and methods

### Useful resources

There were so many references that I sought throughout the project that it would be too extensive to mention them without forgetting to mention someone. But sources like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Tabnews](https://www.tabnews.com.br/), [Medium](https://medium.com/) and many other articles and documentation like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) itself, [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/) helped me throughout the development.
